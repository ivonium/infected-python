# infected-python
This is a two dimensional simulator that simulates infection of entities moving at random on a two dimensional 
plane. The user is given an option to input parameters, including the size of the two dimensioal plane, the amount of 
starting infectious units, the amount of starting non-infectious units, and in one branch, the amount of "healers" 
and other such.

The two dimensional plane may represent a central train station, shopping centre, park or any such other open-plan 
social space in the real world.

Entities, who are called "Units" in the program,  move at random for the sake of simplicity.

This is my first project on Python3, I started planning and writing code for this program on 23 March 2023.
